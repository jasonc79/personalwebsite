# personalwebsite
Tech Stack: React, Node.js, HTML/CSS

Creating a personal website to showcase my skills in web development. I built this project to not only learn about web development
but also showcase myself to future employers. Just to note, from starting this project, I've had little experience in HTML and CSS in highschool
I've had quite a lot of experience in Javascript from building RESTful APIS for a backend server (mock Microsoft Teams). I have no experience in React and
databases so my goal is to learn these two concepts and build on top of this advanced HTML and CSS that I haven't done in a long time.

Challenges

Features

Contact Us Form with a backend database (frontend/backend)

Photo Album in 'My Travels' page (frontend)

Responsive Website (done at the end)
Ensure that all devices are compatible with my website (look into flex layout)
