# personalwebsite
Tech Stack: React, Node.js, HTML/CSS

Creating a personal website to showcase my skills in web development. I built this project to not only learn about web development
but also showcase myself to future employers. Just to note, from starting this project, I've had little experience in HTML and CSS in highschool
I've had quite a lot of experience in Javascript from building RESTful APIS for a backend server (mock Microsoft Teams). I have no experience in React and
databases so my goal is to learn these two concepts and build on top of this advanced HTML and CSS that I haven't done in a long time.

Challenges
Implementing nodemailer was difficult as a beginner because I ran into many errors that wouldn't show up in my compiler. Examples was the auto reply email wasn't sending it's email and wasn't giving an error, but I solved this by cleaning up my code and using async/await for my functions to ensure my code was running asynchronously.
